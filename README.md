# Follow Upets - Collar

This project is part of a C.S department course assignment.

The assignment is to think of a product that will help people in their daily lives, and to develop a prototype of the product.

The product we chose to develop is a collar for pets that will help the owner to track the pet's location and communicate with it.

## Description:
Pets have evolved into cherished family members, providing joy and unconditional love.

The fear of losing them is a distressing reality for many pet owners. But with the revolutionary Follow Upets Collar, utilizing advanced GPS technology, you can track your pet's real-time location, ensuring they never go astray.

Moreover, the collar's audio module enables remote communication with your furry friend through voice commands or pre-recorded messages, granting peace of mind from anywhere in the world.


## Features:

ðŸ’Ž **Real-Time GPS Tracking:** The Follow Upets Collar employs advanced GPS technology to track and display your pet's live location on the mobile app. Stay informed about your pet's whereabouts at all times.

ðŸ’Ž **Voice Message Playback:** Send stored voice recordings to your pet through the collar. Deliver affectionate messages, cues, or reassurance from afar.
